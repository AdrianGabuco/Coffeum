            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Coffeum, your destination for exceptional coffee and warm hospitality. 
                Founded in 2020, Coffeum began as a passion project by Adrian Gabuco and Erica Jane Vasquez, 
                a dedicated coffee enthusiast with a vision to create a haven for coffee lovers. What started 
                as a humble corner café has evolved into a beloved establishment that brings people together 
                over the love of exceptional coffee.</p>
            <h3>Values</h3>
            <p>At Coffeum, our values are rooted in authenticity, community, and craftsmanship. 
                We believe in fostering connections, inspiring creativity, and delivering an unforgettable
                 experience to every guest who walks through our doors.
            </p>
            <h4>Commitment to Quality</h4>
            <p>Our commitment to quality is unwavering. We source the finest beans from around the world, 
                working directly with farmers who share our passion for excellence and ethical practices. 
                Every batch of coffee is roasted with precision to preserve the distinct flavors that make
                 each origin unique.

                Our baristas are artisans, meticulously trained to craft each cup with precision and care. 
                From the moment the beans are ground to the final pour, every step is a celebration of the art 
                and science behind a perfect cup of coffee.
                
                We also take pride in our dedication to sustainability. From our eco-friendly packaging to our
                 partnerships with local suppliers, we aim to make a positive impact on the environment and
                  the communities we serve.
                </p>
            <h5>Creating Moments</h5>
            <p>Coffeum  isn't just about coffee; it's about creating moments. Whether you're seeking a 
                peaceful retreat to catch up on work, a spot to connect with friends, or simply a place to
